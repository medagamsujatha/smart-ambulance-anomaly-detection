Project description :This project presents a safety‑critical time‑series machine learning system designed for real‑time patient vitals monitoring in a Smart Ambulance environment. The system processes continuously streamed physiological signals including Heart Rate (HR), SpO₂, Blood Pressure (systolic and diastolic), and motion or vibration data. It focuses on handling noisy and artifact‑prone sensor data before performing anomaly detection to identify early warning signals rather than simple threshold violations.

The solution incorporates explicit artifact detection, signal preprocessing, feature engineering, and anomaly modeling to detect potential patient deterioration during transport. A multi‑factor risk scoring mechanism combines multiple vitals, trend behavior, and confidence estimation to generate meaningful and safety‑aware alerts. Alert performance is evaluated using precision, recall, false alert rate, and latency, along with detailed failure analysis to understand system limitations.

The model is deployed as a reproducible ML service using a REST API (FastAPI/Flask), ensuring clean architecture, modular code structure, and engineering discipline suitable for safety‑critical healthcare applications.
